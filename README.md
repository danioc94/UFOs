# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to build a website that can showcase different UFO sightings, from data gathered over the US using Javascript as a development tool. We then want to show how the data can be filtered dynamically in real time.

## Results
This is what our original wesite home page looks like:

Here we can see a selection of filters that can be applied to our data table:

Searching any of these filters will dynamically output a filtered table with the results found. Example of what would be seen if we filter by the state and us "fl":

We can then filter our results even more if we keep making changes to the rest of the filters:

## Summary
All the website functionality works properly. For future development it would be recommended to have an option to download the filtered data as well as giving users the option to upload any new UFO sightings that they have.
